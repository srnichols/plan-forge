# Phase AUDITOR-AUTOMATION — Tier the sense-making layer (Watcher / Forge-Master observer / Auditor)

> **Status**: **HARDENED — awaiting Execution Hold lift**. Cleared for `pforge run-plan` once Execution Hold checklist is satisfied. Step-2 harden completed 2026-05-19.
> **Source**: [docs/research/gh-aw-agent-factory-comparison.md](../research/gh-aw-agent-factory-comparison.md) §3 A4 (meta-agent) + carryover from Phase-WORKER-GUARDRAILS retro.
> **Tracks**: `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` (end-of-run hook + watcher cross-run mode), `pforge-master/` (new observer tool + budget + prompt), `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md` (data-source widening), `.forge.json` schema (3 new opt-in blocks), CLI surface (`pforge master observe`), docs sweep.
> **Estimated cost**: medium. Most work is wiring on existing infra. Cluster C is the only LLM-cost-additive slice and is gated behind opt-in + per-day budget cap.
> **Pipeline**: Specify ✅ → Harden ⏳ → HOLD → Execute → S9 unit QA → S10 testbed E2E + chaos → S11 docs → S12 retro.
> **Recommended starting cluster**: **Cluster A — Auditor auto-invoke** (S0 → S1 → S2) because it validates that the A4 auditor produces useful output before we invest in Clusters B and C.
> **Session budget**: 13 slices. Recommended break points: **commit + new session after S2** (end of Cluster A — gives time to evaluate auditor signal quality before B/C build on it), **after S6** (end of Cluster C infra slices, before reasoning prompt work), and **after S9** (unit QA green; fresh session for testbed E2E which has different failure modes than unit tests).

## Execution Hold

Hardened plan MUST NOT execute until:

- [ ] No competing in-flight plan is modifying `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs`, `pforge-master/server.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/config.mjs`, or `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md` (this phase touches all five)
- [ ] At least one `pforge run-plan` run has completed since Phase-WORKER-GUARDRAILS shipped, so A4 has real run data to consume (S1 needs evidence the auditor produces useful output)
- [ ] `master` is clean
- [ ] `lockHash` (added in Step-2 harden) matches plan body at run time
- [ ] OpenBrain is configured (`brain_recall` works) — auditor's data sources depend on it for cross-session memory

**To resume**: change Status to `HARDENED — cleared for execution YYYY-MM-DD` and run `pforge run-plan docs/plans/Phase-39-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-PLAN.md`.

## Why this phase exists

Today the three sense-making roles are partially built:

| Role | Component | Today | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sensor** (cheap, rule-based, live) | Watcher (`runWatch`, `runWatchLive`) | Per-run only | No cross-run aggregation |
| **Live sense-maker** (LLM, narrative, push) | — | does not exist | Forge-Master is pull-only |
| **Retrospective sense-maker** (LLM, narrative, batch) | A4 Plan Health Auditor | Manual invocation only | No auto-trigger; can't see watcher's cross-run signal |

This phase closes those three gaps as cleanly-separated tiers — *cheap → expensive*, *live → historical*, *structured → narrative* — so no component duplicates another's role:

- **Watcher** stays a pure observer (no LLM). It gains aggregation but never gains reasoning.
- **Forge-Master observer mode** adds the LLM narrative layer for live events (rate-limited, budgeted, mute-by-default).
- **A4 Auditor** stays retrospective but starts being auto-invoked and starts consuming the watcher's cross-run output.

Each piece is opt-in. No existing plan, hook, or config needs editing for the phase to ship.

## Scope Contract

### In Scope

**Cluster A — Auditor auto-invocation (Option 1)**:
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — end-of-run hook reads `.forge.json` `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor`; spawns Forge-Master with `@plan-health-auditor` message on failure or every Nth completed run
- `.forge/auditor-state.json` (new, gitignored) — persists `runsSinceLastAudit` counter
- `templates/.forge.json` + `.forge.json` schema — `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor: { onFailure: boolean, everyNRuns: number|null }` (defaults: `{ onFailure: false, everyNRuns: null }` → today's behavior)

**Cluster B — Watcher cross-run mode (Option 2)**:
- `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` — extend `runWatch()` with `mode: "cross-run"`; new `buildCrossRunSnapshot(.forge/runs/*, { window: 14d })` aggregates run summaries; reuses existing `detectWatchAnomalies()` + `recommendFromAnomalies()` against the aggregate
- New anomaly codes: `cross-run.recurring-gate-failure`, `cross-run.retry-rate-spike`, `cross-run.cost-anomaly-trend`, `cross-run.slice-timeout-cluster`
- `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md` — add `forge_watch (mode: "cross-run")` to the agent's tool allowlist; add it to §"Data Sources" table so the auditor uses pre-computed anomalies instead of re-scanning logs by hand

**Cluster C — Forge-Master observer mode (Option 3)**:
- `pforge-master/server.mjs` — register new `forge_master_observe` tool (sibling of `forge_master_ask`); subscribes to the hub WebSocket using the same `.forge/server-ports.json` discovery path `runWatchLive` uses
- `pforge-master/src/observer-loop.mjs` (new) — event-batch buffer (window: 60 s default), narration dispatch, rate limiter
- `pforge-master/src/observer-budget.mjs` (new) — daily $ cap + hourly narration cap, both enforced before any LLM call
- `pforge-master/src/observer-prompt.mjs` (new) — "narrate notable patterns" system prompt distinct from `runTurn()`'s Q&A prompt
- `pforge-master/src/config.mjs` — extend `getForgeMasterConfig()` with `observer: { enabled: false, batchWindowMs: 60_000, maxNarrationsPerHour: 6, maxUsdPerDay: 0.50, brainCapture: true, dashboardCard: false, modelTier: null }` AND `auditor: { modelTier: null }` (both `null` defaults mean "inherit ask mode")
- `pforge-master/src/model-resolver.mjs` (new) — resolves capability tier (`"flagship" | "mid" | "fast" | null`) to concrete provider/model via existing model registry; `null` → inherit ask mode. Vendor model IDs live in the registry, NEVER in observer/auditor code.
- `pforge-master/src/allowlist.mjs` — register `forge_master_observe` description for the tool catalog
- `pforge.ps1` + `pforge.sh` — `pforge master observe --start | --stop | --status` subcommand wrapping the MCP tool

**Tests** (every slice + S9 + S10):
- `pforge-mcp/tests/auditor-auto-invoke.test.mjs` (new — covers S1 + S2)
- `pforge-mcp/tests/watcher-cross-run-mode.test.mjs` (new — covers S3 + S4)
- `pforge-master/tests/observer-loop.test.mjs` (new — S5)
- `pforge-master/tests/observer-budget.test.mjs` (new — S6, includes budget-exceeded-blocks-LLM-call case)
- `pforge-master/tests/observer-reasoning.test.mjs` (new — S7)
- `pforge-master/tests/observer-cli.test.mjs` (new — S8)
- Updates to any existing test that asserts the old "Forge-Master has 1 tool only" invariant (search.test.mjs, self-test, etc.)

**Testbed scenarios** (S10 deliverables, executed via existing `forge_testbed_run` framework against `E:\GitHub\plan-forge-testbed` per `.forge.json` `testbed.path`):
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/auditor-auto-invoke-on-failure.json` — trigger a deliberate plan failure on the testbed, assert `.forge/health/latest.md` appears within 90 s; assert auditor tokens attribute to `forge-master` source (not parent run) via `forge_cost_report`
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/auditor-auto-invoke-every-n.json` — run 5 small plans on testbed with `everyNRuns: 5`, assert exactly 1 auditor report generated; counter resets to 0
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/auditor-no-double-fire.json` — run a plan that both fails AND hits `everyNRuns` threshold; assert single auditor invocation
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/watcher-cross-run-anomalies.json` — run `forge_watch({ mode: "cross-run" })` against testbed's real `.forge/runs/` (has 30+ historical runs); assert `cross-run.*` codes present and `recommendFromAnomalies()` returns non-empty
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/observer-mute-by-default.json` — fresh testbed config; invoke `forge_master_observe`; assert refusal with "observer disabled" error and zero LLM cost in `cost-history.json`
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/observer-budget-fail-closed.json` — enable observer with `maxUsdPerDay: 0.01`; replay 100 events from `hub-events.jsonl`; assert spend never exceeds cap, exactly the right number of narrations happen before budget block, block event logged
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/observer-process-lifecycle.json` — `pforge master observe --start --detach` → verify pid file → send SIGTERM → `--stop` graceful exit → verify pid file removed; restart, send 50 hub events, verify all consumed
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/observer-chaos-kill-mid-narration.json` — start observer; send batch that triggers narration; SIGKILL observer mid-LLM-call; verify (a) Brain has no half-written narration, (b) budget state shows no phantom spend, (c) ask-mode Forge-Master still responds normally
- `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/auditor-spawn-isolation.json` — force auditor auto-invoke 3 times; assert each spawn appears as separate child process in process tree; assert tokens land in `forge-master` source, never in parent run's slice budgets

**Docs sweep** (S11):
- `docs/capabilities.md` + `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` `TOOL_METADATA` — register `forge_master_observe`; document watcher `mode: "cross-run"`
- `docs/llms.txt` + root `llms.txt` — auto-discovery payload
- `docs/manual/customization.html` — Lifecycle Hooks section (`hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor` block)
- `docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html` — new `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor` + `forgeMaster.observer` + `forgeMaster.auditor` config blocks (including `modelTier` knob with capability-tier guidance: `flagship` for quality, `mid` for balance, `fast` for high-volume cheap narration, `null` to inherit ask mode)
- `docs/manual/environment-variables-reference.html` — `PFORGE_FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_DISABLE=1` (kill switch)
- `docs/manual/errors-and-exit-codes.html` — new `observer-budget-exceeded`, `auditor-spawn-failed` codes
- `docs/manual/glossary.html` — "Forge-Master Observer", "Cross-Run Watcher", "Auditor Auto-Invoke"
- `docs/manual/book-index.html` — index entries
- `docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md` — note the new `pforge master observe` workflow
- `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` — `master observe` subcommand
- `CHANGELOG.md` — one entry per cluster; group under a single MINOR bump (multiple `feat:` commits → MINOR)

**Pre-existing surfaces that need code-level updates** (hardcoded lists/arrays that auto-discovery does NOT cover — surgical edits at known line numbers; assigned to the cluster that adds the underlying capability):

| Surface | Line | Today | Needed change | Owning slice |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pforge.ps1` `$liveGuardHooks` array | ~line 3428 | `("PostSlice", "PreAgentHandoff", "PreDeploy")` | append `"PostRun"` so `pforge smith` reports it as expected | **Cluster A S1** (same slice that creates the hook) |
| `pforge.ps1` `$configKeyMap` hash | ~line 3431 | 7 PascalCase→camelCase entries | add `"PostRun" = "postRun"` so smith detects the `.forge.json#hooks.postRun` configuration block | **Cluster A S1** |
| `pforge.sh` symmetric LiveGuard hooks check | _absent_ — bash currently only enumerates session hooks at ~line 2893 | `expected_hooks=("SessionStart" "PreToolUse" "PostToolUse" "Stop")` | If bash parity for LiveGuard hooks gets added later, ensure `PostRun` is included. **No-op this phase** unless bash parity is broadened — call out for awareness, not change. | _Awareness only_ |
| `pforge-master/server.mjs` `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler | ~line 108 | `return { tools: [FORGE_MASTER_ASK_TOOL] };` | `return { tools: [FORGE_MASTER_ASK_TOOL, FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_TOOL] };` (matches MUST #6 "exactly 2 tools" assertion) | **Cluster C S5** (slice that registers the tool) |
| `pforge-master/server.mjs` self-test banner | ~line 183-186 | "1 tool: forge_master_ask" | "2 tools: forge_master_ask, forge_master_observe" (already locked by Forbidden Action #13) | **Cluster C S5** |
| `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` `buildForgeMasterCapabilities()` | line 3084 | `tools: ["forge_master_ask"]` | `tools: ["forge_master_ask", "forge_master_observe"]` so `forge_capabilities` surfaces both | **Cluster C S5** |
| `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` `studio:` block | lines 3076–3082 | Exposes `reasoningModel`, `routerModel`, `promptCatalogVersion` | Add `observerEnabled: <bool>` reading `forgeMaster.observer.enabled` from config, so dashboard / agent introspection can detect observer state without re-parsing `.forge.json` | **Cluster C S5** |

> **Why this matters**: `pforge smith` and `forge_capabilities` are agent-facing diagnostic surfaces. If they don't enumerate the new hook + tool, every consuming agent (including future Forge-Master sessions) will believe the capability doesn't exist. This is a classic auto-discovery gap.

### Out of Scope

- **Anything not listed in §"In Scope"**. This is not a refactor pass.
- Flipping `observer.enabled` to `true` by default (this phase ships it off — flip is a later decision after we see real cost data)
- Watcher gaining LLM-based reasoning (deliberate separation — keep Watcher cheap)
- Forge-Master observer writing to git, calling write tools, or creating PRs (read-only; budget enforcement happens before any side effect)
- Dashboard card UI for observer narrations (config schema reserves `dashboardCard: false`; actual UI is a follow-up phase)
- A4 auditor opening PRs with proposed patches (still read-only per its `readonly: true` frontmatter; PR-opening is a separate later decision per the original Idea 3 deferral)
- Replacing or deprecating `forge_master_ask` — observer is a sibling, not a successor
- Changing the **default** model Forge-Master uses for reasoning — defaults inherit ask mode. (`modelTier` knob lets operators override, but the shipped default does not change current behavior.)
- Adding new entries to the model registry — `modelTier` resolves against whatever models the existing registry already exposes
- **Dashboard settings form fields** for the new `forgeMaster.observer.*` and `forgeMaster.auditor.*` knobs (CLI + `.forge.json` only this phase; dashboard surface is the explicit scope of the follow-up [docs/plans/Phase-40-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-UI-PLAN.md](Phase-40-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-UI-PLAN.md))
- **Dashboard cards** for observer narrations, cross-run watcher anomalies, or auditor latest report (also deferred to the UI follow-up phase)
- Migrating any existing plan or `.forge.json` to use the new opt-in blocks
- Touching `pforge-sdk/`, `extensions/`, `presets/`, `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs` (universal tripwire)
- Cross-machine observer aggregation (single-machine only this phase)

### Forbidden Actions

- **Do NOT modify** `costForLeg()` at `pforge-mcp/cost-service.mjs:309-318` (v2.83.0 protected — universal tripwire)
- **Do NOT** make `observer.enabled` default to `true`. It MUST default to `false`. Mute-by-default is a hard requirement.
- **Do NOT** allow the observer to skip the budget check on any code path. Every LLM call MUST first consult `checkBudget()` and fail closed (block, never spend) on exceed.
- **Do NOT** ship a cap of `null` or `Infinity` for `maxUsdPerDay`. Cap must be a finite positive number. `0` is allowed (effectively disables observer LLM calls).
- **Do NOT** wire the observer to invoke any write tool, even via Forge-Master's existing approval-card path. Observer mode is strictly read-only; approvals only make sense in interactive `ask` mode.
- **Do NOT** auto-invoke the A4 auditor on **every** successful run by default. The default for `everyNRuns` MUST be `null` (off). Reasonable opt-in values are 5–25.
- **Do NOT** call the A4 auditor through the worker's model billing. Spawn it as its own Forge-Master process so its tokens land in `forge_cost_report` under `forge-master` source, not the parent run's cost.
- **Do NOT** introduce a new top-level CLI verb other than `pforge master observe`. All other behavior reaches users via `.forge.json` config blocks.
- **Do NOT** modify `forge_master_ask`'s signature, tool list, or system prompt — observer is additive, never subtractive.
- **Do NOT** bundle slices into one commit. Each slice = one commit. S0 / S9 / S10 / S11 also each = one commit.
- **Do NOT** edit `/memories/repo/*.md` files as part of this phase — auditor reads them; this phase does not curate them.
- **Do NOT** add a `postinstall` script or implicit observer auto-start. Observer starts only when user runs `pforge master observe --start` or sets `observer.enabled: true` in `.forge.json`.
- **Do NOT** change `pforge-master/`'s startup banner from "1 tool: forge_master_ask" without updating the corresponding self-test (`--self-test` path at `pforge-master/server.mjs:183-186`).
- **Do NOT** hardcode any specific vendor model identifier (e.g., `"claude-opus-4.7"`, `"gpt-5"`, `"grok-4"`) in `observer-*.mjs`, `model-resolver.mjs`, the auditor agent file, or the system prompts. Model selection MUST flow through `modelTier` → registry resolution. Vendor IDs age out; capability tiers don't.
- **Do NOT** make `modelTier` default to anything other than `null` (inherit). Picking a non-inherit default would change Forge-Master's effective model behind the user's back.
- **Do NOT** push commits, tags, or branches to the testbed repository at `E:\GitHub\plan-forge-testbed` during S10. Testbed scenarios MUST be self-contained (setup → execute → teardown) and leave the testbed git tree exactly as found. If a scenario needs to mutate testbed files, restore them in `teardown`.
- **Do NOT** skip the `teardown` step in any testbed fixture. Skipping teardown poisons later scenarios and breaks the suite's idempotency guarantee.

## Resolved Decisions

Decisions locked at draft time; Step-2 hardener may sharpen but should not re-litigate.

1. **Three-tier scoping** — Watcher = sensor (no LLM, rule-based). Forge-Master observer = live sense-maker (LLM, batched, budgeted, push). A4 Auditor = retrospective sense-maker (LLM, batch, pull or auto-invoked). No tier duplicates another's role.
2. **Mute by default for observer** — `observer.enabled: false` in shipped `.forge.json`. Users opt in explicitly. No surprise costs.
3. **Budget caps are mandatory, finite, and fail-closed** — `maxUsdPerDay` and `maxNarrationsPerHour` are required schema fields, not optional. Code path that checks budget MUST run before any LLM call. Exceed → block, never spend.
4. **Auditor auto-invoke defaults to off** — `onFailure: false`, `everyNRuns: null`. Users opt in. (Sub-decision: when both `onFailure` and `everyNRuns` fire on the same run, run auditor once, not twice.)
5. **Watcher cross-run reuses existing infra** — `mode: "cross-run"` extends `runWatch()`; reuses `detectWatchAnomalies()` + `recommendFromAnomalies()` against an aggregate snapshot. No new anomaly classifier; only new anomaly codes.
6. **Observer hub discovery mirrors Watcher** — same `.forge/server-ports.json` lookup, same `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` connect, same `ws` lib dependency. Symmetric infra means a single failure mode for both.
7. **Observer output channels** — primary: write narration as a Brain thought (capture into `/memories/repo/` if `brainCapture: true`). Secondary (deferred): dashboard card. CLI status command shows last N narrations from Brain.
8. **A4 auditor data-source widening only** — Cluster B does NOT change the auditor's report format. It only changes where the "Top Failure Modes" section gets its data (pre-computed cross-run anomalies instead of raw log scan).
9. **Auditor spawn isolation** — auto-invoked auditor runs in a child Forge-Master process so its token usage attributes to `forge-master` in `forge_cost_report`, not to the parent `pforge run-plan` invocation's cost.
10. **`pforge master observe --start` is foreground-by-default** — like `forge_run_plan`, `--start` blocks until Ctrl+C; `--start --detach` for daemon mode. `--status` and `--stop` work against either.
11. **No new write paths — observer uses allowlist semantics** — observer cannot call write-capable MCP tools. Bridge filter (A8 from prior phase) is the enforcement mechanism. **Resolved at Step-2 harden**: observer's tool session declares an **allowlist** (`tools.allow`), not a deny-list. The shipped allowlist is exactly: `["brain_recall", "forge_search", "forge_plan_status", "forge_watch"]` — four read-only context-gathering tools the observer needs to narrate intelligently. **Rationale**: deny-list enumeration of ~100 `forge_*` tools invites bit-rot; every new tool added to Plan Forge would silently expand the observer's surface unless someone remembered to update the deny list. Allowlist is strictly safer for the observer's read-only contract: it survives addition of new tools by default (they're blocked unless explicitly added), and the surface area is small enough to review in one read. If a future use case requires another tool, the addition is a single-line change with explicit security review — not a silent default expansion.
12. **Naming** — tool is `forge_master_observe` (verb-final, mirrors `forge_master_ask`). CLI is `pforge master observe`. Config block is `forgeMaster.observer`. Internal modules are `observer-*.mjs` under `pforge-master/src/`.
13. **Configurable model per role, sensible inherit-default** — observer and auditor each expose a `modelTier` knob (`"flagship" | "mid" | "fast" | null`) under `forgeMaster.observer.modelTier` and `forgeMaster.auditor.modelTier`. Default for both is `null` = inherit ask mode's model — so out-of-the-box behavior is unchanged. Operators who care can dial each role independently: observer often wants `mid` or `fast` (high frequency, batch latency budget), auditor often wants `flagship` (infrequent, deep retrospective synthesis). Knob exists for both roles even though only observer is built this phase, because auditor benefits from the same plumbing and adding it later would require schema churn.
14. **Capability tier, not vendor model ID** — `modelTier` is `"flagship" | "mid" | "fast" | null`, NOT `"claude-opus-4.7"` or `"gpt-5"`. The existing model registry resolves tiers to concrete vendor models. Rationale: vendor IDs (Opus 4.7, GPT-5, Grok-4) age out in months; capability tiers are stable. Operators who need vendor-specific selection still have it via the existing provider/model fields elsewhere in the registry — this knob is the *role-scoped* layer on top.
15. **Testbed E2E + chaos validation is a release gate, not optional** — unit tests (S9) are necessary but insufficient for this phase because all three capabilities (auditor auto-invoke, cross-run watcher, observer) interact with real processes, real hub events, real LLM calls, and real budget state on disk. S10 runs against `E:\GitHub\plan-forge-testbed` via the existing `forge_testbed_run` framework (no new framework). Includes chaos scenarios (kill mid-narration, force race conditions) because budget atomicity and process isolation cannot be unit-tested credibly.

## Required Decisions

All 15 architectural decisions are locked in §"Resolved Decisions" above. Step-2 harden resolved the one remaining TBD (RD #11 — observer tool surface) by switching from deny-list to allowlist semantics; no other TBDs exist.

| # | Decision | Status | Where |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1-10 | Three-tier scoping, mute defaults, budget caps, auto-invoke defaults, watcher cross-run reuse, hub discovery, output channels, A4 data-source scope, spawn isolation, CLI foreground-by-default | ✅ Resolved at draft | RD #1-10 |
| 11 | Observer tool surface (`tools.allow` vs `tools.deny`) | ✅ Resolved at Step-2 | RD #11 — allowlist of 4 read-only tools |
| 12-15 | Naming, model-tier knob, capability-tier abstraction, testbed E2E as release gate | ✅ Resolved at draft | RD #12-15 |

## Slice Decomposition

> **Parallelism summary**: All slices are tagged **[sequential]**. Within clusters, each slice depends on its predecessor (S2 on S1, S6 on S5, etc.). Across clusters, Cluster B (S3-S4) is independent of Cluster A in code but depends on it for empirical validation (auditor must actually auto-invoke before we wire cross-run data into it meaningfully). Cluster C (S5-S8) builds the heaviest new infra and depends on neither A nor B in code but conceptually completes the three-tier model only when all three clusters ship. **Recommended session breaks**: after S2 (Cluster A green, evaluate signal quality), after S6 (observer infra + budget done, before reasoning prompt work), after S9 (unit QA green, fresh session for testbed E2E).

### S0 — Baseline test harness

- **Depends On**: nothing (Phase-WORKER-GUARDRAILS must have shipped per Execution Hold, but enforced outside slice graph)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge-mcp/watcher.mjs`, `pforge-master/server.mjs`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` (end-of-run path), `.forge.json` schema
- **Traces to**: MUST #7 (baseline regression protection)
- Captures today's behavior of: `runWatch(targetPath)` snapshot output (golden file), `runWatchLive(targetPath, onEvent)` event stream shape (golden file), `forge_master_ask({ message })` happy-path response shape, `runPlan()` end-of-run path (no auditor invoke today), `.forge.json` schema rejects unknown `hooks.postRun.*` keys today (will pass after S1), `pforge-master/server.mjs` exposes exactly 1 tool today (will be 2 after S5)
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/auditor-automation-baseline.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

### Cluster A — Auditor auto-invocation

**S1 — `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor.onFailure`**

- **Depends On**: S0
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` (end-of-run path), `pforge-master/server.mjs`, `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md`, `.forge.json` schema validator
- **Traces to**: MUST #1, MUST #10
- Read `.forge.json` `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor` block in orchestrator end-of-run path
- On `summary.status === "failed"` AND `onFailure: true`, spawn child Forge-Master process with message `@plan-health-auditor analyze last 14 days`
- Spawn is best-effort: failure to spawn logs a warning but never bubbles up to the parent run
- Attach auditor receipt (process id, exit code, generated report path) to `summary._auditor`
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/auditor-auto-invoke.test.mjs -t onFailure', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

**S2 — `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor.everyNRuns`**

- **Depends On**: S1 (shares the auditor-invoke spawn path)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` (counter persistence path), `.forge/auditor-state.json` (new gitignored state file)
- **Traces to**: MUST #2
- Persist `runsSinceLastAudit` counter to `.forge/auditor-state.json` (gitignored, atomic write)
- Increment on every completed run (pass or fail); when counter ≥ `everyNRuns`, invoke auditor and reset counter
- Counter starts at `everyNRuns` so first run after enabling triggers
- If both `onFailure` (and run failed) and `everyNRuns` would fire on the same run, invoke once and reset
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/auditor-auto-invoke.test.mjs -t everyNRuns', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

### Cluster B — Watcher cross-run mode

**S3 — `runWatch(mode: "cross-run")`**

- **Depends On**: S0 (baseline captures pre-cross-run `runWatch` shape)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential] (within Cluster B; B itself is conceptually parallel to Cluster A in code, but recommended sequential per session-break advice above)
- **Context Files**: `pforge-mcp/watcher.mjs` (`runWatch`, `detectWatchAnomalies`, `recommendFromAnomalies`), `.forge/runs/*/summary.json` (data source shape)
- **Traces to**: MUST #3
- New `buildCrossRunSnapshot(rootDir, { window: "14d" })` reads `.forge/runs/*/summary.json` filtered by `startTime` within window
- Aggregates: total runs, pass/fail counts, slice retry rates, per-slice failure-mode buckets, cost trend
- Feeds aggregate through existing `detectWatchAnomalies()` (extend with cross-run anomaly codes — new codes only, no signature change)
- Returns same `{ ok, anomalies, recommendations, snapshot }` shape — no breaking change to `forge_watch` callers
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/watcher-cross-run-mode.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

**S4 — Wire cross-run watcher into A4 auditor**

- **Depends On**: S3 (auditor agent reads `mode: "cross-run"` data; the mode must exist first)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md`, `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` (tool-call dispatch)
- **Traces to**: MUST #3 (auditor consumes cross-run output)
- Update `.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md`: add `forge_watch` to `tools:` list with `mode: "cross-run"` usage note; update §"Data Sources" table to replace raw log scan reference with cross-run watcher invocation; add §"Recommended Invocation" guidance
- Behavior verification: invoke `forge_master_ask({ message: "@plan-health-auditor weekly report" })` against the current repo; verify report's §"Top Failure Modes" cites cross-run watcher output
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('.github/agents/plan-health-auditor.agent.md','utf8'); if(!/mode:\s*[\"']cross-run[\"']/.test(c))throw new Error('agent file missing cross-run mode usage'); if(!c.includes('forge_watch'))throw new Error('agent file missing forge_watch tool reference'); console.log('ok auditor agent wired to cross-run watcher');"
  ```

### Cluster C — Forge-Master observer mode

**S5 — Observer infra: hub subscription + event-batch buffer**

- **Depends On**: S0 (baseline captures pre-observer server.mjs tool count of 1)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential] (within Cluster C; C does not depend on A/B in code)
- **Context Files**: `pforge-master/server.mjs` (tool registration), `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs`, `pforge-mcp/hub.mjs` (event shapes), `pforge-mcp/watcher.mjs` (port-discovery pattern to mirror), `.forge/server-ports.json`
- **Traces to**: MUST #6
- New `pforge-master/src/observer-loop.mjs`: `startObserver({ batchWindowMs, onBatch })` connects to hub via `.forge/server-ports.json` (mirrors `runWatchLive` discovery); buffers events in memory; flushes to `onBatch(events[])` every `batchWindowMs`; handles WebSocket disconnect with bounded backoff (3 retries, then surface error); reserves outbound hub-publish channel for `observer:narration` events (actual emission wired in S7)
- New `forge_master_observe` tool in `pforge-master/server.mjs` with input schema `{ action: "start" | "stop" | "status", sessionId?, detach? }`
- Tool currently echoes batches back (no LLM yet — S7 wires that)
- Self-test path updated: now expects 2 tools (`forge_master_ask`, `forge_master_observe`)
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-master'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/observer-loop.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

**S6 — Budget caps**

- **Depends On**: S5 (budget enforcement attaches to observer-loop call path)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge-master/src/observer-loop.mjs` (S5 output), `pforge-master/src/config.mjs` (budget field validation), `.forge/forge-master-observer-state.json` (new gitignored state file)
- **Traces to**: MUST #5
- New `pforge-master/src/observer-budget.mjs`: `checkBudget(state, { maxUsdPerDay, maxNarrationsPerHour })` pure function returning `{ ok, reason? }`; `recordSpend(state, { usd, timestamp })` pure function returning updated state; state persists to `.forge/forge-master-observer-state.json` (atomic write, gitignored)
- Wire budget check **before** any LLM call site (none exist yet — S7 will be the first; this slice asserts wiring is impossible to forget)
- Test state-machine covers: (under-cap → ok), (over-narration-cap → block), (over-usd-cap → block), (day-rollover → reset), (hour-rollover → reset), (concurrent spend → atomic)
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-master'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/observer-budget.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

**S7 — Reasoning loop: narrate notable patterns**

- **Depends On**: S5 (observer infra), S6 (budget enforcement — S7 is first LLM call site)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` (existing `runTurn`), `pforge-master/src/observer-budget.mjs` (S6 output), `pforge-master/src/observer-loop.mjs` (S5 output), `pforge-mcp/brain.mjs` (`brain_capture` plumbing), allowlist enforcement entry from RD #11
- **Traces to**: MUST #4, MUST #5, MUST #6
- New `pforge-master/src/observer-prompt.mjs` — system prompt distinct from `runTurn()`'s Q&A prompt
- Extend `pforge-master/src/reasoning.mjs` with `runObserverTurn(batch, { config, brain })`:
  - Calls `checkBudget()` first; if not ok, log + skip (no LLM call)
  - Initializes tool session with `tools.allow: ["brain_recall", "forge_search", "forge_plan_status", "forge_watch"]` per RD #11 — any tool call outside this list is rejected at the bridge filter
  - Calls existing model surface with observer prompt; receives narration
  - If `brainCapture: true`, writes narration as a Brain thought (existing `brain_capture` plumbing)
  - Calls `recordSpend()` with actual usage from model response
  - Emits `observer:narration` event on the hub with payload `{ timestamp, batchEventCount, narration, usd, modelTier }`
- Observer loop's `onBatch` callback now calls `runObserverTurn`
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-master'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/observer-reasoning.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

**S8 — CLI surface: `pforge master observe`**

- **Depends On**: S5 (`forge_master_observe` tool exists), S7 (reasoning loop wired so CLI has something to drive)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `pforge.ps1` (master subcommand block, around line 3428 per pre-existing surface map), `pforge.sh` (mirror), `pforge-master/src/observer-loop.mjs`, `.forge/forge-master-observer.pid` (new gitignored pid file)
- **Traces to**: MUST #6 (CLI surface for observer)
- `pforge.ps1` + `pforge.sh` — `master observe --start | --stop | --status [--detach]`
- `--start` (no `--detach`): blocks foreground until Ctrl+C; pretty-prints each narration
- `--start --detach`: forks observer process; writes pid to `.forge/forge-master-observer.pid`
- `--stop`: reads pid file, signals SIGTERM, waits for graceful shutdown
- `--status`: prints budget state, running/stopped, last N narrations from Brain
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-master'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/observer-cli.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

### S9 — Full QA sweep

- **Depends On**: S0-S8 all green
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: all test files added in S0-S8 + pre-existing `pforge-mcp/tests/` + `pforge-master/tests/`
- **Traces to**: MUST #7
- Run ALL new test suites together; verify they don't regress each other or existing suites:
  - `pforge-mcp/tests/auditor-auto-invoke.test.mjs`
  - `pforge-mcp/tests/watcher-cross-run-mode.test.mjs`
  - `pforge-master/tests/observer-loop.test.mjs`
  - `pforge-master/tests/observer-budget.test.mjs`
  - `pforge-master/tests/observer-reasoning.test.mjs`
  - `pforge-master/tests/observer-cli.test.mjs`
  - Plus the pre-existing full `pforge-mcp` and `pforge-master` test suites
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "const {execSync}=require('child_process'); process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); execSync('npx vitest run', {stdio:'inherit'}); process.chdir('../pforge-master'); execSync('npx vitest run', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  ```

### S10 — Testbed E2E + chaos validation

- **Depends On**: S9 (unit QA must be green before investing in slower E2E)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `E:\GitHub\plan-forge-testbed` (testbed root, resolved via `.forge.json` `testbed.path`), `pforge-mcp/server.mjs` (`forge_testbed_run`, `forge_testbed_happypath`, `forge_testbed_findings`), `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/` (new fixture directory)
- **Traces to**: MUST #8, MUST #9, MUST #10
- For each scenario in §"Testbed scenarios" list (under Scope Contract): create fixture JSON, add test in `pforge-mcp/tests/testbed-auditor-automation.test.mjs` that calls `forge_testbed_run({ scenarioId })`, verify assertions pass
- For chaos scenarios specifically: verify system reaches clean state after chaos event (no orphaned processes, no half-written state files, no budget phantom spend)
- Also runs existing `forge_testbed_happypath` suite to verify no pre-existing scenario regressed
- **Validation Gate** (two separate commands so a failure isolates cleanly):
  ```bash
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run tests/testbed-auditor-automation.test.mjs', {stdio:'inherit'});"
  node -e "process.chdir('pforge-mcp'); const m=require('./server.mjs'); Promise.resolve(m.forge_testbed_happypath({dryRun:false})).then(r=>{if(!r||r.ok===false)throw new Error('happypath regressed'); console.log('ok happypath');}).catch(e=>{console.error(e.message); process.exit(1);});"
  ```

### S11 — Docs sweep + auto-discovery

- **Depends On**: S8 (CLI shape final), S7 (config blocks final)
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: `docs/capabilities.md`, `docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html`, `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md`, `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs`
- **Traces to**: DoD (auto-discovery requirement)
- Per the §"Docs sweep" list in Scope Contract. Regenerate `forge_capabilities` output and verify all new tools/flags/configs appear.
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs --check
  node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const cap=fs.readFileSync('docs/capabilities.md','utf8'); const ref=fs.readFileSync('docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html','utf8'); if(!cap.includes('forge_master_observe'))throw new Error('capabilities.md missing forge_master_observe'); if(!ref.includes('hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor'))throw new Error('forge-json-reference missing hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor'); console.log('ok docs sweep complete');"
  ```

### S12 — Retro

- **Depends On**: S0-S11 all green
- **Parallelism**: [sequential]
- **Context Files**: this plan file (appends `## What actually shipped` section)
- **Traces to**: DoD (postmortem requirement)
- Append §"What actually shipped" to this plan file: final commit SHAs per slice, deviations from draft (slices added/removed/reordered, scope drift), known gotchas surfaced during execution (especially testbed-only failures from S10), carryover for next phase (e.g., dashboard card UI for observer, A4 auto-PR mode, observer cross-machine aggregation)
- **Validation Gate**:
  ```bash
  node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('docs/plans/Phase-39-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-PLAN.md','utf8'); if(!c.includes('## What actually shipped'))throw new Error('retro section missing'); console.log('ok retro appended');"
  ```

---

## Re-anchor Checkpoints

Lightweight re-anchor (4 yes/no) after every slice. Full re-anchor against §"Scope Contract" + §"Resolved Decisions" at these breakpoints (these match the session-break recommendations):

- **After S2** (Cluster A complete): full re-anchor. Specifically verify (a) auditor auto-invoke produces useful output against real run data, (b) counter atomicity holds under concurrent writes, (c) auditor child process correctly attributes tokens to `forge-master` (RD #9), (d) no auditor invocation has occurred when both `onFailure` and `everyNRuns` are off. If signal quality is poor, STOP — Cluster B/C should not build on a weak auditor.
- **After S6** (Cluster C infra + budget done, before reasoning loop): full re-anchor + atomicity-focused review. Specifically verify (a) budget state file uses atomic-write (rename, not in-place mutation), (b) no LLM call site exists yet anywhere in observer code path (S7 is first), (c) hub subscription survives WebSocket disconnect cleanly, (d) allowlist enforcement entry point exists and is reachable from `runObserverTurn` (per RD #11). Catch budget-bypass bugs HERE, not after S7 ships an LLM call that can spend real money.
- **After S9** (unit QA green, before testbed E2E): full re-anchor. Specifically verify (a) zero pre-existing tests regressed in either workspace, (b) all 6 new test files exist and pass, (c) baseline golden files from S0 still match (catches accidental schema drift in `runWatch` / `forge_master_ask` shapes), (d) no Forbidden Action triggered across the 9 slices. Fresh session recommended for S10 — E2E failure modes differ from unit-test failure modes (real processes, real hub, real budget atomicity under SIGKILL).

---

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### MUST

1. After Cluster A: a failed `pforge run-plan` with `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor.onFailure: true` MUST write `.forge/health/latest.md` within 60 s of run end without manual intervention.
2. After Cluster A: with `everyNRuns: 5`, exactly one auditor invocation MUST occur per 5 completed runs (no double-fire, no skips).
3. After Cluster B: `forge_watch({ mode: "cross-run", targetPath: <repo> })` MUST return at least one `cross-run.*` anomaly when given a `.forge/runs/` directory containing ≥2 historical failures of the same slice across different runs.
4. After Cluster C: with `observer.enabled: false` (default), `forge_master_observe` MUST refuse to start and return a clear "observer disabled" error. No LLM call may occur.
5. After Cluster C: with `observer.enabled: true` and a `maxUsdPerDay: 0.01` budget exhausted in the current day, the observer MUST skip narration generation and log a budget-block event. No LLM call may occur.
6. After Cluster C: `pforge-master/server.mjs --self-test` MUST report exactly 2 tools (`forge_master_ask`, `forge_master_observe`) and exit 0.
7. Across the whole phase: every test from S0 through S9 MUST pass. Existing suites MUST NOT regress.
8. After S10: all 8 testbed scenarios MUST exit `passed`. Any `blocker`- or `high`-severity finding in `forge_testbed_findings` output is a release-stop.
9. After S10: `observer-chaos-kill-mid-narration` and `observer-budget-fail-closed` scenarios MUST pass without modification or retry. Flaky behavior on either is a release-stop — budget atomicity and process isolation cannot be "good enough".
10. After S10: `forge_cost_report` MUST show auditor spawn tokens attributed to `forge-master` source. Zero auditor tokens may attribute to the parent run.

### SHOULD

1. Observer's batch narration latency SHOULD be ≤ 5 s p95 from batch flush to Brain capture (excluding LLM call duration).
2. Cross-run watcher SHOULD scan ≤ 100 ms p95 against a `.forge/runs/` directory of ≤ 100 runs.
3. Auditor auto-invoke SHOULD reuse the existing Forge-Master process if one is already running (avoid duplicate spawn on rapid successive runs).
4. Observer SHOULD batch low-signal events (e.g., heartbeat pings) into a single "N similar events" line in the narration prompt rather than echoing each one.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 13 slices' gates green; S9 unit QA green; S10 testbed E2E + chaos green; S11 docs gate green
- [ ] **Reviewer Gate passed (zero 🔴 Critical, zero 🟡 High that block scope)** — Session 3 sign-off: no Scope Contract drift, no Forbidden Action triggered, all MUST criteria met
- [ ] All 8 testbed scenario fixtures committed to `docs/plans/testbed-scenarios/`
- [ ] `forge_testbed_findings --severity blocker` and `--severity high` both return zero findings for this phase
- [ ] Postmortem written; cost ≤ projected band; analyze score ≥ 90
- [ ] Auto-discovery (`forge_capabilities`) lists new tool (`forge_master_observe`), new config blocks (`hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor`, `forgeMaster.observer`, `forgeMaster.auditor`), new anomaly codes (cross-run.*)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` entry promoted from `[Unreleased]` → `[<next-MINOR>] — YYYY-MM-DD — Auditor Automation (Observer + Cross-Run Watcher)` per the release checklist (this phase = MINOR, multiple `feat:` commits)
- [ ] Observer allowlist (RD #11) verified at runtime: integration test confirms a bridge-filter rejection when observer attempts a non-allowlisted tool call
- [ ] Branch model respected: code/config/test/docs land on `master`; this plan's retro append (S12) is editable on either branch
- [ ] `pforge validate` clean on `master`

---

## Stop Conditions

Halt execution and request human review if any of these fire:

**Scope drift**
- S10 testbed dirties or commits to its own git tree without explicit fixture teardown — testbed isolation breach; this phase MUST NOT push commits to the testbed repo
- Any slice modifies a file outside the in-scope list in §"Scope Contract" — Forbidden Action triggered; revert immediately
- S5/S7 attempt to add a tool to the observer allowlist beyond the four declared in RD #11 without a documented security review on the same commit — STOP; allowlist expansion is a Required Decision, not a slice-time choice

**Build / test failure**
- Any slice's validation gate fails twice consecutively — STOP; do not retry blindly, diagnose root cause
- S6 budget tests fail in a way that suggests the check-then-spend race is not atomic — correctness > speed; do not paper over with retries
- S7 observer LLM call is observed bypassing `checkBudget()` on any code path — this is a Forbidden Action; escalate, do not patch around
- S10 chaos scenario `observer-chaos-kill-mid-narration` shows phantom spend in budget state or orphaned narration in Brain — atomicity bug; do not ship until fixed
- S10 scenario `auditor-spawn-isolation` shows ANY auditor tokens attributing to parent run — cost-attribution bug; violates RD #9
- `pforge validate` fails after any slice — STOP; resolve before continuing

**Behavior / correctness**
- Cross-run watcher returns anomalies that contradict the auditor's findings on the same data (rule classifier and LLM disagree — needs human triage before continuing)
- Auditor auto-invoke creates an infinite loop (auditor's own LLM call triggers a "completed run" event that re-triggers auditor) — must add re-entrancy guard before proceeding
- Hub WebSocket disconnect rate >5% during S5 testing — symptoms of port contention; needs investigation before observer can be relied on

**Security**
- Observer attempts to call a tool not in the four-item allowlist from RD #11 (`brain_recall`, `forge_search`, `forge_plan_status`, `forge_watch`) — STOP immediately; bridge filter is the contract, any leak is a security defect
- Observer or auditor session writes to ANY file outside `.forge/forge-master-observer-state.json`, `.forge/auditor-state.json`, `.forge/health/latest.md`, or the Brain capture target — STOP; write-path violation
- Budget state file is ever written non-atomically (in-place mutation observed) — STOP; race could silently lose spend tracking
- Auditor spawn ever inherits parent process's environment variables containing secrets (`*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`) without explicit allowlist — STOP; secret-leakage risk

---

## Commit Convention

- Each slice = one commit
- S0: `test(auditor-automation): S0 — baseline test harness`
- S1: `feat(orchestrator): auditor auto-invoke on run failure`
- S2: `feat(orchestrator): auditor auto-invoke every N runs`
- S3: `feat(watcher): cross-run mode`
- S4: `feat(agents): plan-health-auditor consumes cross-run watcher`
- S5: `feat(forge-master): observer mode infra — hub subscription + event batching`
- S6: `feat(forge-master): observer budget caps + fail-closed enforcement`
- S7: `feat(forge-master): observer reasoning loop with budgeted LLM call`
- S8: `feat(cli): pforge master observe subcommand`

- S11: `docs(auditor-automation): S11 — docs sweep + auto-discovery`
- S12: `docs(plans): S12 — retro for Phase-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION`

All commits land on `master`. PreCommit chain (shipped in WORKER-GUARDRAILS A3) runs on each.

## Hardening Audit Trail

| Date | Action | By |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-18 | Draft created from Phase-WORKER-GUARDRAILS retro carryover (Option 1 + Option 2 + Option 3 under user's three-tier scoping: Watcher = sensor, Forge-Master observer = live sense-maker, A4 Auditor = retrospective sense-maker) | Copilot session |
| 2026-05-19 | **Step-2 harden**: (a) YAML frontmatter added with `lockHash` field. (b) Status flipped DRAFT → HARDENED. (c) **Resolved Decision #11 — TBD resolved**: switched from deny-list to **allowlist** semantics. Shipped allowlist is `["brain_recall", "forge_search", "forge_plan_status", "forge_watch"]` — four read-only tools. Rationale: deny-list of ~100 tools invites bit-rot and silent surface expansion every time a new `forge_*` tool ships; allowlist is strictly safer for observer's read-only contract and survives new tool additions by default. (d) Acceptance Criteria heading "(DRAFT — to be sharpened by Step-2)" qualifier removed; criteria were already specific (10 MUST + 4 SHOULD), no actual sharpening needed. (e) Per-slice metadata added to all 13 slices: `Depends On`, `Parallelism: [sequential]`, `Context Files`, `Traces to` (Acceptance Criteria MUST-N mapping). (f) **All slice validation gates rewritten in pure `node -e` form** — eliminates W1 lint warnings (`bash -c` prefix per meta-bug #171: `where bash` resolves to WSL on Windows) and meta-bug #93 (nested escaped quotes inside `bash -c`). The S10 gate that previously combined `npx vitest && node -e '...nested escaped quotes...'` is now split into two separate gate lines, each a clean `node -e` invocation. Vitest gates use `node -e "process.chdir(workspace); require('child_process').execSync('npx vitest run testfile', {stdio:'inherit'});"` to keep cwd handling explicit without a shell wrapper. (g) `## Required Decisions` summary table added — confirms all 15 decisions resolved with the location of each. (h) `## Re-anchor Checkpoints` section added with full re-anchors after S2 / S6 / S9 (matching session-break recommendations). (i) Stop Conditions reorganized into Scope-drift / Build-test / Behavior-correctness / Security categories per Runbook; added explicit security entries for allowlist enforcement, atomic budget writes, secret-leakage in auditor spawn. (j) Definition of Done strengthened with verbatim "Reviewer Gate passed (zero 🔴 Critical, zero 🟡 High that block scope)" wording, plus explicit auto-discovery enumeration and a runtime allowlist verification check. **lockHash protects Forbidden Actions list only** — slice headers use `S0/S1` per project convention (not `Slice 0` that `computeLockHash` would match for full slice content). | Copilot session (Step-2) |
| _pending_ | Execution Hold lifted | _pending_ |

## Carryover (explicitly out of this phase)

- **Stable-enum centralization** — [docs/plans/Phase-41-ENUMS-CENTRALIZATION-PLAN.md](Phase-41-ENUMS-CENTRALIZATION-PLAN.md) drafted from this phase's planning friction. The 4 hardcoded-surface updates locked into this plan's Scope Contract (smith hook arrays, capabilities.mjs tool list, server.mjs self-test) are exactly the pattern that drove the enums phase. Execution Hold gates on **this** phase + the UI follow-up shipping first, so enums.mjs seeds with the final post-AUDITOR shape.
- **Dashboard UI follow-up** — [docs/plans/Phase-40-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-UI-PLAN.md](Phase-40-AUDITOR-AUTOMATION-UI-PLAN.md) covers: settings tab for Forge-Master roles (`tab-settings-forgemaster` with `observer.*` and `auditor.*` `cfg-*` fields), observer narrations live card, cross-run watcher anomalies card, auditor latest-report card. Drafted but explicitly gated on this phase shipping first — the UI surfaces depend on the config fields and capabilities this phase creates.
- A4 auditor opening PRs with proposed patches (auditor stays read-only this phase)
- Cross-machine observer aggregation (single-machine only this phase)
- Watcher → auditor real-time escalation (when watcher fires a critical anomaly mid-run, auto-invoke auditor with that anomaly as a hint — needs Cluster A + Cluster B to ship first to evaluate signal quality)
- Auto-tuning `everyNRuns` based on observed failure rate (constant default this phase; learning is a separate concern)

## Appendix A — S11 Docs Sweep Pre-Work

> **Why this exists**: S11 is mechanical, low-creativity work. This appendix front-loads the discovery so the slice runs cheap (low model, single session). Every target below has been verified against the current repo state at draft time. If the file structure shifts before execution, fall back to grep — but most rows should match exactly.

### Target inventory (verified at draft time)

| # | File | Insertion anchor | Pattern in file | What to add |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` | After the `forge_master_ask:` block (~line 1605) | `grep -n "forge_master_ask: {" pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` | New `forge_master_observe:` entry in `TOOL_METADATA` — mirror `forge_master_ask` shape: `intent`, `description`, `agentGuidance` ("Use to start/stop the live observer that narrates notable hub events…"), `inputSchema` matching the tool's actual params, `example.output` showing a `{ ok, status, processId? }` payload. Also update the existing `forge_watch:` block (~line 1306) to document `mode: "cross-run"` in its `inputSchema` enum. |
| 2 | `docs/capabilities.md` | The `## MCP Tools (89)` table around line 9–105 | `grep -n "forge_master_ask" docs/capabilities.md` (~line 88) | (a) Insert new row for `forge_master_observe` directly under `forge_master_ask`, category `reasoning`, cost `medium`, description: live narrative observer (read-only, budgeted, mute-by-default). (b) Update header count `## MCP Tools (89)` → **`(90)`**. (c) Edit existing `forge_watch` row to mention `mode: "cross-run"` after "Snapshot or analyze mode." |
| 3 | `docs/manual/glossary.html` | Three insertion points | `grep -n "<strong>Watcher</strong>\|<strong>Forge-Master</strong>\|<strong>Crucible</strong>" docs/manual/glossary.html` (~lines 89, 137, 96) | Add three new `<tr>` rows: **Forge-Master Observer** (after the existing Forge-Master row at line 137), **Cross-Run Watcher** (after Watcher at line 89), **Auditor Auto-Invoke** (place near Forge-Master row). Also bump the embedded count: `<!--c:tools-->90<!--/c-->` → `91` at line 158 (matches capabilities.md tool count). |
| 4 | `docs/manual/customization.html` | "LiveGuard and orchestration hooks" table (~line 228) | `grep -n "hooks-liveguard\|hooks.preAgentHandoff" docs/manual/customization.html` (~lines 228, 247) | Insert a new `<tr>` row in the table between the `PostSlice` and `PreAgentHandoff` rows: hook=`PostRun`, trigger="After every `pforge run-plan` completion (success or failure)", effect="Spawns Forge-Master with `@plan-health-auditor` when `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor.onFailure` is true and the run failed, OR every Nth completed run when `everyNRuns` is set. Auditor invocation tokens attribute to the `forge-master` source, never the parent run.", blocks="No (advisory)", configure=`hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor`. |
| 5 | `docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html` | After `hooks.preCommit.chain[]` (~line 280) AND a brand-new `<h2 id="forgeMaster">` section | `grep -n "hooks-preCommit\|<h2 id=\"openclaw\"" docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html` | (a) Insert `<h3 id="hooks-postRun"><code>hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor</code></h3>` block after preCommit. Three keys: `onFailure` (boolean, default `false`), `everyNRuns` (number\|null, default `null`, validated 5–25), `cooldownMinutes` (number, default `5` — re-entrancy guard). Use the same `<table class="manual-table">` shape as existing hook tables. (b) Insert new top-level `<h2 id="forgeMaster"><code>forgeMaster</code> — Forge-Master observer + auditor</h2>` section, ideally before `<h2 id="hooks">` so reasoning config sits with the rest of the role config. Two subsections: `<h3 id="forgeMaster-observer">` (keys: `enabled`, `batchWindowMs`, `maxNarrationsPerHour`, `maxUsdPerDay`, `brainCapture`, `dashboardCard`, `modelTier`) and `<h3 id="forgeMaster-auditor">` (key: `modelTier`). For each `modelTier` row, document the canonical tokens `null | "flagship" | "mid" | "fast"` with `null` = inherit ask mode. Also update the top-of-file `hooks` summary line (~line 205) "Four hook configurations" → **"Five hook configurations"** and append `<code>postRun</code>` to the enumeration. |
| 6 | `docs/manual/environment-variables-reference.html` | `<h2 id="feature-toggles">` (line 155) | `grep -n "feature-toggles" docs/manual/environment-variables-reference.html` | Insert a new row in the Feature toggles table: `PFORGE_FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_DISABLE`, default unset, value `"1"`, effect="Kill switch. When set, `forge_master_observe` and `pforge master observe --start` immediately refuse with a clear error. Takes precedence over `.forge.json#forgeMaster.observer.enabled`. Use during incidents to disarm the observer fleet-wide without editing config." |
| 7 | `docs/manual/errors-and-exit-codes.html` | `<h2 id="named-error-catalog">` (line 167) | `grep -n "named-error-catalog" docs/manual/errors-and-exit-codes.html` | Add two `<tr>` rows: **`observer-budget-exceeded`** (raised by `pforge-master/src/observer-budget.mjs` when `maxUsdPerDay` or `maxNarrationsPerHour` cap is hit; remediation: widen cap in `.forge.json#forgeMaster.observer` or wait for daily reset) and **`auditor-spawn-failed`** (raised by `pforge-mcp/orchestrator.mjs` when the post-run auditor spawn cannot reach Forge-Master; remediation: check `forge_master_ask` works manually, then re-run the failed plan to re-trigger). |
| 8 | `docs/manual/book-index.html` | The alphabetical index entries (~line 568+) | `grep -n "hooks.postSlice\|hooks.preAgentHandoff" docs/manual/book-index.html` (~lines 572, 576) | Add three entries in alphabetical order: `.forge.json — forgeMaster.auditor`, `.forge.json — forgeMaster.observer (modelTier, budgets)`, `.forge.json — hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor`. Use the same `<div class="font-semibold text-slate-200 min-w-[14rem] text-sm">` markup as siblings. |
| 9 | `docs/llms.txt` AND root `llms.txt` | Auto-discovery payload | `grep -n "^## \|^# " llms.txt docs/llms.txt` | Append `forge_master_observe` to the tool inventory and a one-line "Auditor auto-invoke + cross-run watcher anomalies + live observer narrations" under §"Capabilities" / §"Key Concepts" as appropriate. Total tool count bumps from 89 → 90 (matches capabilities.md). |
| 10 | `docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` | `pforge master ask` reference, if present (else add a "Forge-Master" sub-section) | `grep -n "master ask\|^## \|^### " docs/CLI-GUIDE.md` | Document `pforge master observe --start [--detach] \| --stop \| --status`. Note daemon mode, pid file location (`.forge/forge-master-observer.pid`), graceful SIGTERM shutdown, and that observer respects `PFORGE_FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_DISABLE`. |
| 11 | `docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md` | Forge-Master workflow section, if present (else add) | `grep -n "forge_master_ask\|Forge-Master" docs/COPILOT-VSCODE-GUIDE.md` | Add: "**Live observer** — Run `pforge master observe --start` in a long-lived terminal during a `run-plan`. Narrations land in OpenBrain and surface via `brain_recall` in subsequent ask-mode prompts. Disable globally with `PFORGE_FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_DISABLE=1`." |
| 12 | `CHANGELOG.md` | `[Unreleased]` section | `grep -n "## \[Unreleased\]" CHANGELOG.md` | One grouped entry: `### Added — Forge-Master Observer + Cross-Run Watcher + Auditor Auto-Invoke`. Bullets: (a) `forge_master_observe` tool — read-only live narrator (mute-by-default, daily budget cap). (b) `forge_watch({ mode: "cross-run" })` — aggregates `.forge/runs/*` for cross-run anomalies. (c) `hooks.postRun.invokeAuditor` — auto-spawn A4 auditor on failure or every Nth run. (d) `forgeMaster.observer.modelTier` + `forgeMaster.auditor.modelTier` knobs. (e) New env var `PFORGE_FORGE_MASTER_OBSERVE_DISABLE` kill switch. (f) New named errors `observer-budget-exceeded`, `auditor-spawn-failed`. Promotion to a versioned heading happens in the release slice, NOT in S11. |

### Auto-discovery verification (executor checklist after edits)

After all rows above are applied, run these to confirm coverage:

```bash
# Total tool count consistency: docs say 90, server must say 90
node pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs --check
grep -c "^| \`forge_" docs/capabilities.md        # expect 90 (was 89)
grep -c "<!--c:tools-->90<!--/c-->" docs/manual/glossary.html   # expect 1

# All three sense-making roles surfaced in glossary
grep -E "Forge-Master Observer|Cross-Run Watcher|Auditor Auto-Invoke" docs/manual/glossary.html

# forge-json reference has the new config blocks
grep -E "id=\"hooks-postRun\"|id=\"forgeMaster-observer\"|id=\"forgeMaster-auditor\"" docs/manual/forge-json-reference.html

# Error catalog has both new codes
grep -E "observer-budget-exceeded|auditor-spawn-failed" docs/manual/errors-and-exit-codes.html

# Hardcoded diagnostic surfaces (Scope Contract §"Pre-existing surfaces")
# — these MUST have been edited by their owning slice; S11 verifies they landed.
grep -q '"PostRun"' pforge.ps1                                    # expect match (smith)
grep -q '"PostRun" = "postRun"' pforge.ps1                        # expect match (smith config map)
grep -q 'forge_master_observe' pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs        # expect match (forge_capabilities)
grep -q 'forge_master_observe' pforge-master/server.mjs           # expect match (self-test tool list)
node pforge-master/server.mjs --self-test 2>&1 | grep -q '2 tools' # expect exit 0 + "2 tools" in banner
pforge smith 2>&1 | grep -qE 'PostRun|postRun'                    # expect smith reports PostRun present
```

All seven greps and the two node/cli probes must produce non-empty output / zero exit.

### Pre-flight grep sentinel (run BEFORE starting S11)

If any of these grep'd values has changed since this appendix was written (e.g. tool count drifted from another phase), DO NOT execute S11 blindly — update the affected rows above first:

| Value | Expected at draft time | Re-check command |
|---|---|---|
| Tools count in `docs/capabilities.md` heading | `## MCP Tools (89)` | `grep -E "^## MCP Tools \([0-9]+\)" docs/capabilities.md` |
| Tools count in `docs/manual/glossary.html` | `<!--c:tools-->90<!--/c-->` (already 90 — pre-existing drift; +1 → 91 after this phase) | `grep -E "c:tools-->[0-9]+<" docs/manual/glossary.html` |
| `forge_master_ask:` line in capabilities.mjs | ~line 1605 | `grep -n "forge_master_ask: {" pforge-mcp/capabilities.mjs` |
| Hook table row count in `customization.html` | 3 rows in "LiveGuard and orchestration hooks" | `grep -c "<tr>" docs/manual/customization.html` (note: includes other tables) |
| Settings tab count in `dashboard-settings.html` (used by UI follow-up plan) | 9 `<h3 id="settings-">` | `grep -c "<h3 id=\"settings-" docs/manual/dashboard-settings.html` |
